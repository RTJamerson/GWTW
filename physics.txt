//physics will be used on the bullets, the plane, the monster, and the air coming from the fans
//the air coming from the fans will affect the flight of the plane

//the equations for the physics of the plane were given in class on 9/7/15
// location = 1/2 (acceleration) * (time elapsed)^2 + velocity * (time elapsed) + starting location
// velocity = starting velocity + (accelaration) * (time elapsed)

//the monster will have a constant max velocity that will be reached when it is traveling straight for a long enough period
//the monster will have a set acceleration to reach the max velocity

//the bullets will have a set velocity
// the equation for the monster and bullet are:
// location = velocity * (time elapsed) + starting location

//graviy will affect the plane when the user "dives" or "climbs"
//the gravitational pull will be -10 meters per second^2

//the air from the fans will give the plane lift and will temporarily increase velocity
//the ammount the air will increase the planes velocity will be determined by a trial and error method
